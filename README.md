# LittleHumans

This is a game that I developed using the Blackthorn Productions Game Dev Rocket Launchpad course. The assests were premade for me but everything else was added by myself with guidance from the course.
I plan to iterate on this game as I believe it could be made to have better features such as:

- [ ]  Score System
- [ ]  Shop
- [ ]  Upgradeable Speeds for Resource Collection
- [ ]  Resource Spawners (like the villages in game)
- [ ]  Different Lose Conditions
- [ ]  New Levels
- [ ]  Menu UI added
- [ ]  Sound Effects added

I will use this as a personal project for the start of 2025, eventually posting this to Itch.io.
